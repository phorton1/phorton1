## vGuitar - Virtual Guitar Rig I use in Live Performances

The vGuitar rig is a
[Foot Pedal](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-teensyExpression)
and
[Looper](https://github.com/phorton1/circle-prh-apps-Looper)
that interfaces to an iPad which provides Guitar Effects and a
Synthesizer for an
[Fishman Triple Play](https://www.fishman.com/tripleplay/)
(FTP) guitar synthesizer pickup.

There are many repositories involved.  A second version
of the foot pedal,
[teensyExpression2](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-teensyExpression2)
has been published, and, as of this writing, I am proceeding with a new
*proof of concept* **prototype**
[teensyPiAudio](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-teensyPiAudio)
device that I am hoping will provide the foundation of an
entirely new (and very much simplified) architecture for the
vGuitar rig.

Please see those other repositories, and particularly the
[teensyPiAudio](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-teensyPiAudio)
repository for a view of what I am currently working on.
