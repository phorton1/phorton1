## History of the vGuitar (Virtual Guitar) Rig

As of this writing, in 2024, at the age of 67, I have now been both a professional
guitar player, and a professional computer programmer for 46 years. I got my first
full-time programming job in 1978 at the age of 21, and had already done more than
a few music gigs for money by that time.

It is useful for me to recount and document the history leading up to the inception
of this system, as well as understanding and documenting the history of the system
itself.



## Pre-System History

For most of my life I used typical store-bought effects like distortion and wah-wah pedals,
phase shifters, chorus, and echo boxes from many different manufactures, generally moving,
over time, from from individual pedals and boxes for each function to integrated guitar
effects devices from a few reliable manufacturers.

I've never been a screaming electric guitar player, always more of a singer with an
acoustic guitar, so, although there were times when I had specific guitar amplifiers
to play loud and produce signature sounds, what evolved was a generic rig that could be
plugged into a PA (or any good clean amplifier) and easily moved into a recording
environment with predictable results.

By about 1995, my rig had essentially evolved (or devolved?) into a single multi-effects
device and a loop pedal going into a PA, although I might still occasionally throw in a separate
volume pedal or separate (better sounding) wah-wah. With the advent of the Boss line of
floor baaed guitar Loopers, around 2004, I started using a looped guitar in my gigs with
some regularity.

The long and short of it is that by the time of the inception of these projects my
rig was pretty stable.  From about 2005 until about 2016 I typically plugged my guitar
into a multi-effects device, plugged that into a Looper, and plugged that into a
small Yamaha PA that I would haul around to do gigs at local restaurants and bars.

I typically prefer the smaller multi-effects devices, having 3 buttons and one foot
pedal, over the larger 5 button kinds, as they are easier to haul around.

There were a number of seminal events, around 2017, nearly coincident in time,
for me, that spurred me to begin to create my own electronics devices for use in my rig:

- I got a **Prusa 3D Printer**, at the same time as
- I started messing with **Arduinos**, Teensies, and Raspberry Pi MPUs (Micro Processing Units), and
- I got a **Fishman Triple Play** (FTP) guitar synthesizer pickup

I got my first (and only so far - still running strong!) 3D printer on general principle, just
wanting to see what they were and could do.  As I am also a now-retired computer programmer it
was fairly natural for me to start messing around with Arduinos and other MPUs, especially
after I quickly realized that the Arduino, was, essentially powering the whole 3D printing
movement.

I got the FTP because I had always been interested in guitar synthesizers but had
never liked the onerous hardware requirements that came with them, like special guitars, huge
floor devices, cables with 13 pins, and so on.  So when I saw a high quality guitar synth
that could be easily retrofitted to ANY guitar and which communicates wirelessly to a
USB dongle, frankly, I had to have one.

## Brief Rig History

So that's where the story begins.  I had my stable floor based guitar multi-effects device
and looper and a brand new FTP guitar synthesizer. The first thing I did, of course, was
to insert the FTP (somehow) into my existing rig.  Although the FTP came with a bunch
(and I mean a bunch) of software for running on Macs or Windows PCs,  I really never wanted
to bring a laptop to a gig, so the first thing I had to do was essentially throw out all
of the FTP software and throw in an **iPad**.

*At that time Fishman had no IOS specific software, and now that I have developed my
stuff, after limited testing of their later presentations, I still prefer my approach
which is specifically not coupled to any specific external software implementations.*
