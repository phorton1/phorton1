## What's New?


- 2024-05-09 - Begin redesign of a new, greatly simplified
[vGuitar system](vGuitar.md) that combines the previously separate
[Looper Box](https://github.com/phorton1/circle-prh-apps-Looper),
eliminating most of it's *guts*, into a single optimizized
[teensyExpression3](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-TE3)
foot pedal with a new *teensy 4.x* based
[USB Audio](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-TE3_audio)
interface.

- 2024-05-06 - Made intermediate development repo
[teensyExpression2](https://github.com/phorton1/Arduino-teensyExpression2)
public.

- 2023-10-10 - I added
[Buddy](https://github.com/phorton1/base-apps-buddy) a
general purpose COM and Telnet port monitor that
includes a [Installer](https://github.com/phorton1/base-apps-buddy/tree/master/releases)
for Microsoft Windows

  Foot Pedal and the
  [Looper Box](https://github.com/phorton1/circle-prh-apps-Looper)

  create the Virtual Guitar rig that I use in live performances.
- [**Artisan**](Artisan.md)
  is a system for organizing and presenting a **Music Library** of
  Audio files, *like MP3s*, contained in a single folder tree on one or
  more computers on a home network.
  The system consists of *Programs* and *Libraries* that organize and
  present that Library in a variety of manners, mostly centered around
  the notion of being a completely compliant with various standards
